SConsProject

	The SConsProject module proposes you a way to easily create the compilation
	system of your project with the minimum of informations.

	The main functionnalities are:
	- It setups the file tree for build objects.
	- It allows you to declare dependencies to external or internal libraries.
	  For external libraries, there is a predeclared list of standard libraries
	  with the headers, link flags and dependencies.
	- It loads configuration files, so each developper can setup the
	  installation with specific paths to libraries, etc.
	- It proposes some utility functions.
	- It's only an helper around SCons, so you can always overload it or mix it
	  with native SCons code.
